This is a lift texture mod for Scrap Mechanic.This changes the lift texture and the icon for the lift with the custom texture too.

NOTE:- Since this mod changes the icon map for Scrap Mechanic , if you are also using any other mod that adds new parts or just changes the icons for the game , 
this mod's icons will not work. If you are installing this mod after installing an other mod that changes the game files , this mod will remove all the other icons from
the other mod that you have installed. Workshop mods should work fine with this mod installed.

INSTALLATION:-

2. Go to the folder that has that lift skin of your liking.
